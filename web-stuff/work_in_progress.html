						After struggling with the Tsiolkovsky rocket equation for nearly a century, which dictates how
						much fuel a rocket needs to carry to propel itself to its Target, Electric propulsion systems
						have
						shown themselves to be one of the most reliable and energy efficient models for future human
						deep
						space exploration and travel. using a fraction of the of fuel needed for traditional space
						craft,
						greatly increasing payload capacity and boasting auto refueling capacities mid-journey. China's
						Tiangong Space Station recently achieved a new first, by successfully installing an ion thruster
						system onto their craft [Jon21] solidifying the implications and future potential of this

							<h2>1 Introduction</h2>
							<p class="article-text-para">
								To move forward we push things back, the rate at which we push them determines how fast
								we go .Classical chemical rockets use a oxidiser to explosively expand fuel at a rate
								enough to push their payload which is usually less than 10\% of the weight of the
								rocket.It was this problem that led to the invention of one of its first alternatives
								the electrical propulsion system Instead of pushing lot of stuff very past for lot of
								force EP (Electric propulsion) pushes very little VERY fast for very long

								Instead of relying on the combustion of fuel to generate thrust, ion propulsion depends
								upon accelerating electrically charged particle to exponentially higher speed than the
								exhaust gas This innovative approach results in significantly higher exhaust velocities,
								enabling spacecraft equipped with ion propulsion to achieve greater speeds while
								consuming far less propellant.

							<h2>2 Mathematical modeling of the Motion of a Rocket</h2>
							<h3>2.1 Tsiolkovsky rocket equation</h3>
							<p class="article-text-para">
								The classical rocket equation, or ideal rocket equation is a mathematical equation that
								describes the motion of vehicles that follow the basic principle of a rocket: a device
								that can apply acceleration to itself using thrust by expelling part of its mass with
								high velocity can thereby move due to the conservation of momentum.

							<h3>2.2 implications of this Equation</h3>
							<p class="article-text-para">
								Here we see the graph of the Tsiolkovsky rocket equation plotted for the percentage of
								total mass ejected on the x-axis and the instantaneous change in velocity on the y axis
								. each of the plot lines plots for a different velocity of ejection of gas . Here we the
								primary conflict of rocket propulsion .
								Classical chemical rockets use a oxidiser to explosively expand fuel at a rate enough to
								push. By the end of the 70s scientist had figured out a way to cheat the equation.
								Instead of increasing the rate at which mass was ejected. They could increase the speed
								at which it was ejected. Which instead reduced the mass ejection requirement

							<h2>3 The Hall Type Electronic Propulsion Engine</h2>
							<h3>3.1 Working</h3>
							<p class="article-text-para">
								The Hall-effect thruster operates on the principle of the Hall effect, which is the
								production of a voltage difference (Hall voltage) across an electrical conductor,
								transverse to an electric current in the conductor and a magnetic field perpendicular to
								the current. In the case of a Hall thruster, the conductor is the plasma, the electric
								current is generated by the ionized propellant, and the magnetic field is provided by
								magnets
							</p>
							<p class="article-text-para">
								The propellant, consisting of an inert gas such as xenon or krypton at low pressure, is
								pumped into the thruster tube. Because Hall thrusters use inert gas for propellant,
								there is no chance of explosion as for chemical rockets. Any of the trapped electrons in
								the channel collide with the propeller atoms, forming ions. As the propellant ions are
								created, they feel the electrical field formed between the (positive) channel and the
								(negative) electron ring and accelerate out of the thruster, forming an ion beam. The
								thrust is provided by the force given to the electron cloud by the ions. This force is
								applied to the magnetic field and, in turn, is sent to the magnetic circuit of the
								Thruster. The electrons are extremely mobile and drawn to the ions in the beam, allowing
								an equivalent number of electrons and ions to exit the propeller at the same time. This
								allows the thruster to remain electrically inert overall.
							</p>

							<h3>3.2 Power Processing and Source</h3>
							<p class="article-text-para">
								The power supply is normally some source of electrical power such as solar or nuclear
								power. The solar electrical propulsion system (SEP) uses solar panels to produce
								electricity, and the nuclear electrical propulsion system (NEP) uses a nuclear power
								source attached to an electrical generator. This production of electricity is due to the
								power source.
							</p>
							<p class="article-text-para">
								They are circuit machines that transform the electrical input from the utility line to
								the required voltage and current to be used by the system in question. They have the
								same function as linear amplifiers, but they are much more effective because the use of
								linear amplifiers results in a lot of power loss due to the use of a capacitor to shift
								voltage and current. Another usage of the PPU is that the electrical power provided by
								the power source is transferred by the PPU by providing the necessary power to each part
								of the Hall Thruster
