						After struggling with the Tsiolkovsky rocket equation for nearly a century, which dictates how
						much fuel a rocket needs to carry to propel itself to its Target, Electric propulsion systems have
						shown themselves to be one of the most reliable and energy efficient models for future human deep
						space exploration and travel. using a fraction of the of fuel needed for traditional space craft,
						greatly increasing payload capacity and boasting auto refueling capacities mid-journey. China's
						Tiangong Space Station recently achieved a new first, by successfully installing an ion thruster
						system onto their craft [Jon21] solidifying the implications and future potential of this technology

							<h2>1 Introduction</h2>
							<p class="article-text-para">
								To move forward we push things back, the rate at which we push them determines how fast we go .Classical chemical rockets use a oxidiser to explosively expand fuel at a rate enough to push their payload which is usually less than 10\% of the weight of the rocket.It was this problem that led to the invention of one of its first alternatives the electrical propulsion system Instead of pushing lot of stuff very past for lot of force EP (Electric propulsion) pushes very little VERY fast for very long
		
								Instead of relying on the combustion of fuel to generate thrust, ion propulsion depends upon accelerating electrically charged particle to exponentially higher speed than the exhaust gas This innovative approach results in significantly higher exhaust velocities, enabling spacecraft equipped with ion propulsion to achieve greater speeds while consuming far less propellant.

							<h2>2 Mathematical modeling of the Motion of a Rocket</h2>
							<h3>2.1 Tsiolkovsky rocket equation</h3>
							<p class="article-text-para">
								The classical rocket equation, or ideal rocket equation is a mathematical equation that describes the motion of vehicles that follow the basic principle of a rocket: a device that can apply acceleration to itself using thrust by expelling part of its mass with high velocity can thereby move due to the conservation of momentum. 
							</p>
	
							<h3>2.2 implications of this Equation</h3>
							<p class="article-text-para">
								Here we see the graph of the Tsiolkovsky rocket equation plotted for the percentage of total mass ejected on the x-axis and the instantaneous change in velocity on the y axis . each of the plot lines plots for a different velocity of ejection of gas . Here we the primary conflict of rocket propulsion  . 
								Classical chemical rockets use a oxidiser to explosively expand fuel at a rate enough to push. By the end of the 70s scientist had figured out a way to cheat the equation. Instead of increasing the rate at which mass was ejected. They could increase the speed at which it was ejected. Which instead reduced the mass ejection requirement
